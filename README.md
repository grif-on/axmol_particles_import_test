# What is this
This is my testing of .plist particles file ussage in Axmol . But the catch is - .plist was been generated in Cocos Creator .

# How it was been made
Check commits .

# Results
Not bad , but not good eather .

Some manual editing of .plist is required . And results seems to mismatch a little :

I may say , fiddling with Creator only as particle editor is not worth it .

# How to build
You will need axmol 2.2.1 .

Use [official setup guide](https://github.com/axmolengine/axmol/blob/dev/docs/DevSetup.md) .

Or use [my guide about prebuilt setup](https://github.com/axmolengine/axmol/discussions/1989) .

In both cases you would use CMake (or `axmol` console tool , wich utilized CMake under the hood) .
